          <h3> What is the difference of var, let and const function?</h3>
          <p>let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
            Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually denoted by curly braces {}.
            
            var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
            Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.
            
            const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned.
            Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.</p>

          <h3>What is the difference of Arrow function and Regular function?</h3>
          <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="m-3 bg-gray p-3">
          <h3> Why use template?</h3>
          <p>First of all, using a template tag makes it very clear that the HTML inside of it is used in JavaScript in order to render dynamic content. Secondly, the template tag has very handy methods for copying the content inside of it so it can be added to the DOM repeatedly.</p>
